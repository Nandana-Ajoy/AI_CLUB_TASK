# AI_CLUB_TASK

The dataset was collected from the UCI repository and is called the Statlog Heart Disease dataset. Data from 270 different individuals make up the dataset. The dataset has 14 columns that were taken from a larger collection of 75. There are no values missing. The categorization task is to predict whather a person suffers from heart disease or not. There are 13 attributes and a target variable in this database. It predicts either the absence or presence. There are 5 numerical values and 8 nominal values. The following is a full discussion of each of these features:
Age: Patients Age in years (Numeric)
Sex: Gender (Male : 1; Female : 0) (Nominal)
cp: Type of chest pain experienced by patient. This term categorized into 4 category.
0 typical angina, 1 atypical angina, 2 non- anginal pain, 3 asymptomatic (Nominal)
trestbps: patient's level of blood pressure at resting mode in mm/HG (Numerical)
chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl (Numeric)
fbs: Blood sugar levels on fasting > 120 mg/dl represents as 1 in case of true and 0 as false (Nominal)
restecg: Result of electrocardiogram while at rest are represented in 3 distinct values
0 : Normal 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of >
0.05 mV) 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophyby Estes' criteria (Nominal)
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved (Numeric)
exang: Angina induced by exercise 0 depicting NO 1 depicting Yes (Nominal)
oldpeak: Exercise induced ST-depression in relative with the state of rest (Numeric)
slope: ST segment measured in terms of slope during peak exercise
0: up sloping; 1: flat; 2: down sloping(Nominal)
ca: The number of major vessels (0â€“3)(nominal)
thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia
0: NULL 1: normal blood flow 2: fixed defect (no blood flow in some part of the heart) 3: reversible defect (a blood flow is observed but it is not normal(nominal)
target: It is the target variable which we have to predict 1 means patient is suffering from heart disease and 0 means patient is normal.
